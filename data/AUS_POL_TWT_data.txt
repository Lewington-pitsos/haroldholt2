As you say, defining when an attack has been launched is shades of grey. Not impossible to define, but I don't know what the govt' intent here is.
TimWattsMP|2021-10-12T23:06:11.000Z|But by waiting 9 months before acting they've now left themselves so little time to actually act that it's unlikely that any of the government's Ransomware Action Plan (which is totally different from a National Ransomware Strategy) will be legislated before the election‚Ä¶

MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-15T01:40:00.000Z|Horse racing is not about ‚Äòentertainment'. The races continuing through Covid-19 lockdowns, without crowds, revealed as much - not to mention the horrific cruelty to horses revealed over the last few years. It's always been about gambling money and it has to stop. https://t.co/JJ1rsWbHOQ
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-15T00:16:45.000Z|Happy School Strike for Climate Day! I'm so proud to be joining school students from across the country as they rise up &amp; demand change from our political leaders.   This wonderful piece I'm holding was created by the talented @JarraHarwood !  #TheYouthAreRising @StrikeClimate https://t.co/gUhNlKsNSj
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T22:29:26.000Z|People are rejecting horse racing for its animal cruelty and gambling concerns but the main beneficiaries of it ‚Äì the gambling industry ‚Äì continue to finance major party politics, and the impacts are obvious. The special treatment for horse racing goes on.
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T22:29:26.000Z|According to AEC data, donations to the major parties from companies involved in horse betting increased massively between 2010 and 2020. The Liberals, Labor, and Nationals accepted at least $2.7 million over the period.
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T22:29:26.000Z|Animal cruelty &amp; gambling are bankrolling politics. New research conducted by my office has found that as people switch off from racing, companies involved in horse betting are donating more and more to Liberal and Labor. https://t.co/w96CbZT5kb
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T02:35:00.000Z|A timely reminder that the future belongs to all of us ‚Äì not the billionaires. Next election, let's put Greens representatives in Parliament who have the courage to tackle the climate crisis, and hold the greedy corporations &amp; tycoons to account. https://t.co/e9gL4fBqJv
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T00:11:58.000Z|Afghans have suffered immensely under the misogynistic and violent Taliban. There is no justification for giving them a platform.
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-14T00:11:57.000Z|It's good that this terrible event has been cancelled. But the question remains: how on earth did it come to be? Sadly a case of a ‚Äòrepresentative' organisation not representing the community it supposedly stands for. https://t.co/EjYtKXGcxw
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-13T06:04:17.000Z|Sadly, not very surprised to see far-right groups so heavily represented here. Some of these listed groups have targeted my office before. The government has its head in the sand on the extent of far-right organising in this country. https://t.co/rcXGBPMLGe
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-13T04:16:08.000Z|The housing system that exists now is not made for first home-owners or renters, it's made for the property speculators and developers.
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-13T04:16:07.000Z|‚ÄúAstounding price growth and five years of weak income growth have pushed up the cost of an average first home deposit from 70 per cent of income to more than 80 per cent.‚Äù  https://t.co/fLhDPQ4K3s
MehreenFaruqi|2021-10-13T01:07:00.000Z|These numbers show an astronomical rise in house prices over the past year. But they aren't just statistics: they represent the real experiences of people being priced out of owning their first home.
